#ARToolkit for iOS
ARToolKit for iOS runs under [several modern versions][ios_system_support] of Apple's iOS operating system, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices. This page holds links to resources of special interest for developers working with ARToolKit on the iOS operating system and devices.

This document is meant to be a supplement to the existing configuration documentation, such as [calibrating your camera][config_camera_calibration], [configuring video capture][config_video_capture], as well as training [NFT][marker_nft_training] and [traditional][marker_training] markers.

There are [additional functions availible to the iOS camera][ios_camera] in ARToolKit, including high-res image capture. Additionally, it is easy to [include movies in your AR scene][ios_movie_textures]. For more general information, you can read about [reducing your iOS app size][ios_reducing_size], or see [how ARToolKit can integrate with iOS with the ARApp example][example_arapp].
